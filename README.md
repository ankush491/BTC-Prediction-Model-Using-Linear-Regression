Bitcoin Price Prediction Using Linear Regression

This project aims to predict Bitcoin prices using a linear regression model, providing a foundational approach to understanding cryptocurrency market trends. With Bitcoin's high volatility, accurate price prediction can be valuable for investors, traders, and analysts looking to make informed decisions. The model leverages historical data, including daily opening and closing prices, volume, and other relevant financial indicators, to establish relationships and forecast future prices.

The analysis begins with data collection and preprocessing, ensuring the dataset is clean, complete, and suitable for model training. The project employs Python and its powerful data analysis libraries, such as Pandas, NumPy, and Scikit-learn, to handle data manipulation, feature selection, and model implementation. Key features are identified and used in the linear regression model to explore correlations between past trends and future price movements.

The linear regression model is then trained and evaluated, with a focus on minimizing error and improving accuracy. Various metrics, such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), are used to assess the modelâ€™s performance. The results are visualized using Matplotlib and Seaborn, providing clear insights into the predicted versus actual Bitcoin prices, and highlighting the model's predictive capability.

This repository includes the code, datasets, and step-by-step documentation for replicating the analysis and model building process. Users can explore the Jupyter notebooks to understand each phase of the project, from data preprocessing to model evaluation. By following the provided instructions, you can experiment with the model, adjust parameters, and enhance prediction accuracy, making this a great starting point for those interested in cryptocurrency price forecasting and machine learning applications.
